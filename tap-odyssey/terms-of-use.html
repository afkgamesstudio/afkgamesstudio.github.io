        <h1>TAP ODYSSEY — TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
        <p class="date">Last Updated: February 13, 2026</p>

        <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of Tap Odyssey (the “App”), developed by AFK GAMES STUDIO (“AFK,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1) License; Permitted Use</h2>
        <p>Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal use on Android devices you own or control. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by AFK.</p>

        <h2>2) Restrictions</h2>
        <p>Except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law, you may not: (a) copy, modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works of the App; (b) distribute, sell, lease, lend, or sublicense the App; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive source code or underlying ideas or algorithms of the App; (d) remove or alter any proprietary notices; or (e) use the App in any manner that violates applicable law or infringes any third-party rights.</p>

        <h2>3) Ownership; Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The App, including its code, design, user interface, visuals, audio, and gameplay mechanics, is owned by AFK and protected by intellectual property laws. The App’s visual style is an original creative work and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any third party.</p>

        <h2>4) Offline Functionality</h2>
        <p>Core gameplay is intended to operate locally on your device. However, the App may access the internet for advertising, consent, and related functionality (e.g., Google AdMob and consent management). We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability, error-free operation, or compatibility with all devices, Android versions, or system configurations.</p>

        <h2>5) Advertising; Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App may display advertising via Google AdMob and may use other third-party services. Such services may collect and process data as described in their terms and policies and as disclosed in our Privacy Policy (available within the App). Your use of the App is also subject to those third-party terms where applicable. We do not control and are not responsible for the content of third-party advertisements, websites, or services.</p>

        <h2>6) Third-Party Assets; Open Source and Other Notices</h2>
        <p>The App may include third-party assets (e.g., sound effects obtained from third-party providers and generated audio/visual assets) and third-party software governed by separate licenses and/or terms. Applicable notices and attributions are provided in the App’s Licenses/Notices section and/or in accompanying notice files.</p>

        <h2>7) Eligibility</h2>
        <p>The App is intended for a general audience and is not directed to children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use the App. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you may use the App only with the consent of a parent or legal guardian.</p>

        <h2>8) Disclaimers</h2>
        <p class="caps">THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AFK DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. AFK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE.</p>

        <h2>9) Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p class="caps">TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL AFK BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS, OR DEVICE DAMAGE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE APP OR THESE TERMS, EVEN IF AFK HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
        <p>IN ALL CASES, AFK’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) USD $10.00 OR (B) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR ACCESS TO THE APP IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.</p>

        <h2>10) Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your license to use the App at any time if you violate these Terms. Upon termination, you must cease use of the App and uninstall it.</p>

        <h2>11) Changes to the App or Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update the App or modify these Terms from time to time. Updated Terms will be made available through the same channel where you obtained the App and/or within the App. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.</p>

        <h2>12) Governing Law; Venue</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles. You agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the App will be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Orange County, Florida, and you consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in those courts.</p>

        <h2>13) Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>

        <h2>14) Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any notices incorporated by reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and AFK regarding the App.</p>
